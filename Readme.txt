Overview:
My portfolio website is designed to showcase my skills, experience, and projects to potential clients and employers. The website is built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and is hosted on github.

Features:
The portfolio website includes the following features:

Home page: Provides an introduction to myself and my work.
About me: Describes my background, education, and experience.
Projects: Displays my portfolio of projects.
Services: Display the services I provided.
Contact: Provides a contact form for potential clients and employers to get in touch with me.
Challenges:
During the development process, I encountered some challenges with browser compatibility and responsive design. However, I was able to overcome these challenges by testing the website on multiple devices and making adjustments to the code as needed.

Lessons Learned:
Building my portfolio website helped me develop my technical skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I also gained experience in design principles and user experience (UX) design.

Future Improvements:
In the future, I plan to improve the performance of the website by optimizing images and code. I also plan to add more projects to the portfolio and enhance the UX design.
